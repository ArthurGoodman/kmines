2.0.12 (18 May 2001)
 * use KStdGameAction
 * big revamping of highscores
 * use of KHighscore

2.0.11 (14 March 2001)
 * changed highscores accelerator to CTRL + H (more standard)
 * better use of session-management

2.0.10 (23 October 2000)
 * fixed mouse action in settings (autoreveal and toggle mark were inversed)

2.0.9
 * fix obscure bug reported by Tobias Oed (was crashing version 1.0.1a !)
   : mouse buttons were messing things when pressed simultaneously.
 * in the same move : simplified some code and correct a small buglet due to
   rounding error (with left mouse button pressed, the first line and first
   column case was pressed when the mouse was moved just outside the top and
   left side of the field).

2.0.8
 * fix bug that was pausing a stopped game when calling highscores

2.0.7
 * fixed bug in mine field drawing with some styles [found by Gerard Delafond
   and Tobias Kretschmar] that induces a complete rewrite of the drawing code.
   now it honors the global style (beautiful in marble style) and it even
   leads to code simplification !
 * the keyboard cursor uses now the focus drawing method.
 * fixed bug when field.width != field.height when exploding
 * fixed font in the pause button (with non standard case size)
 * fixed behaviour of button in highscores dialog when entering the winner name
   [proposed by Lotta Inkovaara for ksirtet]
 * keyboard is disabled by default

2.0.6
 * use of KMainWindow (replace KTMainWindow) but this does not solve the
   resizing problems :(
 * pause game when high scores requested
 * custom game settings are saved [feature suggested by Toan Nguyen,
   Williaw Barnes and François-Xavier Duranceau]
 * solve the resizing problems by intercepting the Layout Hint event ...
   (due to limitations in K/QMainWindow IMHO)

2.0.5
 * default for mouse binding changed
 * added color configuration for numbers, flag and explosion (for B&W monitors
   and few-colors themes) [feature suggested by Hume Smith and François-Xavier
   Duranceau]
 * moved around some things about configuration (cleaned up "defines.h")
 * case state is now more clean (but some bugs might have crept in)
 * properly mark all the flagged cases with no mine to error on game end
 * versioning the XMLGUI file

2.0.4
 * hack to resize correctly when menu is hidden (due to bugs
   in KTMainWindow)
 * nicer (and simpler) custom level dialog with KNumIntInput
 * kstatusbar in place of the label
 * remove the title in dialogs (more consistent with other apps)

2.0.3
 * use kkeydialog for actions
 * rationalize settings (much better now)
 * animate autoreveal with keyboard
 * enable/disable and change text for pause in menu

2.0.2
 * XMLify the GUI

2.0.1
 * KAction/KAccel integrated
 * keyboard play
 * can choose case size (font is scaled)
 * less flicker in repainting (+ fixed a strange divide negative int by
   uint thing)
 * fix the pixmaps drawing so that they are not too bad in custom case sizes

2.0.0

 * small fixes for custom games
 * "What's This" added.

1.0.6
 * slightly better highscores dialog
 * fixed a bug in flagged mines display (cannot be negative)
 * the LCDs gets red when there are more flagged cases than mines
   and when you have used more time than the better player.
 * use of a status bar.
 * the smiley moods are now XPMs (made by Andreas Zehender)

1.0.5
 * fixed layout handling (all this "updateGeometry" and "LayoutHint" stuff)
 * space bar hit cannot restart game anymore
 * clean code (config) + level is saved

1.0.4
 * porting to QT 2.0

1.0.3 (Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>)
 * fixed the bug in the level selection (showed up with Qt 2.0)
 * fixed layout for Qt 2.0
 * fixed signal/slot handling for Qt 2.0
 * fixed layout with floating menubar
 * level menu items are now checked

1.0.2
 * bug fix : argh! a "brown paper bag" one (bug report by Szokovacs Robert)

1.0.1
 * bug fix : when paused a game can be continued by changing desktops or
   iconifying/deiconifying without time consumption ... (bug report by
   François-Xavier Duranceau, Frank Pieczynski & Oliver Eiden)
 * add printing facility : well it seems hacky to me and certainly not perfect
   but it works ... (feature suggested by Tomislav Marsic)

1.0.0
 * final cleanup before 1.0 !

0.6.12
 * use QLayout for "custom level dialog" and "highscore dialog"

   uncovered cases remain, it was possible to win on clicking on the mine)

0.6.11
 * Added kapp->getHelpMenu() & setCaption() [Robert Williams]

0.6.10
 * included in the CVS tree

0.6.9
 * bugfix from Anders Widell (doesn't allow anymore to middle click on a flag)

0.6.8
 * some polishing (game over message do not overwrite mines number & marked
   mines stay marked even when the game is lost : so you can completely analyse
   why you have lost :) -- thanx to Christoph Rummel for pointing these to me.

0.6.7
 * internationalization

0.6.6
 * no more NULLs (for the sake of 64bits)

 * use kdehelp
 * updating of Makefile (use KDEDIR)

 * use KApp for configuration and highscoring save (via KConfig)
 * better look of option & highscores windows

0.4
 * minor bug fix
 * 4 spaces tabs indentation

0.3
 * the random configuration seems to be a bit too repetitive ...
   (fixed : silly me !)
 * a red cross must show where the marked cases have not contained mines
 * uncover case on button release, not on button push and also allow moving
   the mouse with the left button pressed
 * clear function with the mid*button : it should be kool :)
 * a pause entry in the menu
 * QLCD for timer and mines left
 * cleaning of the highscore stuff (the highscore file is now in the home dir)
