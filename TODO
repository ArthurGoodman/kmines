IDEAS:

 * 3 button mouse emulation [someone seems to need it for wheel mouse : I think
   it should be done at a higher level ...]
   
 * messages from/to a named pipe for external AI + log of game

 * do you have any idea ?


KNOWN BUGS:

 * bug in Aqua theme (rectangle in the upper left part of the field)

 * bug in easy highscores (enable to reproduce !?)
